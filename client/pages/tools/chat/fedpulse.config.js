## 1. The 2024 Election and Presidential Transition

### Presidential Election Results
Donald Trump won the November 2024 election, securing his second non-consecutive term as President of the United States. The final Electoral College count was 312 electoral votes for Trump and 226 for Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump's victory included wins in all seven major battleground states, and he showed improved performance in traditionally Democratic strongholds compared to 2020.

The election followed a tumultuous campaign season marked by several unprecedented events:
- President Biden withdrew from the race in July 2024 following his June debate performance against Trump
- Vice President Harris became the Democratic nominee
- Trump survived an assassination attempt in July 2024 that grazed his ear
- Prosecutors reported foiling a second assassination attempt in September 2024
- Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts in May 2024 but received an unconditional discharge sentence in January 2025

### Congressional Results
Republicans gained control of both chambers of Congress:
- The Senate flipped to Republican control
- Republicans maintained their majority in the House of Representatives
- Some state legislatures also flipped, including the Michigan House to Republican control and the Minnesota House to a tie

### Cabinet and Administration
President Trump assembled his cabinet and administration with key appointments including:
- J.D. Vance as Vice President
