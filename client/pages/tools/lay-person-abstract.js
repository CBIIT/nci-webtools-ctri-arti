## LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS

### Reading Level
- Write at 6th-grade level using common words
- Keep sentences to 5-10 words (fewer is better)  
- Replace medical jargon: "malignant neoplastic cells" → "cancer cells that have spread"

### Voice and Tone
- **Direct address**: Use "you" instead of "participants" or "patients"
  - Instead of: "Participants will undergo blood draws"
  - Use: "You will have your blood drawn"

- **Active voice**: Make actions clear and direct
  - Instead of: "The medication will be administered"
  - Use: "The study team will give you medication"
  - Instead of: "The report will be submitted by the researcher"
  - Use: "The researcher will submit the report"

- **Warm and supportive**: Maintain compassionate, helpful tone throughout

## CONTENT GUIDELINES

### Extraction Rules
- Extract ONLY information explicitly stated in the protocol
- Quote exact sections in the REFERENCES section before translating
- If information is missing, omit that field entirely (do not guess)
- Use exact numbers and timeframes when provided
- Prioritize safety information and time commitments that impact daily life

### Formatting Preferences
- For array fields, break information into discrete, scannable items
- Include approximate timeframes: "about 2 hours" rather than "varies"
- Present side effects by frequency and severity in plain language
- Each array item should be a complete, standalone point
- Use bullet points for sequential procedures in your mind, but format as array items

### Focus Areas
1. **Decision-critical information**: Cover what patients need to know for decisions
2. **Safety information**: Risks, side effects, monitoring
3. **Time commitments**: Duration, visits, daily life impact
4. **Practical details**: Costs, compensation, contacts

## EXAMPLES OF DIRECT ADDRESS
- Instead of: "Participants will undergo three blood draws"
  Use: "You will have your blood drawn three times"
- Instead of: "The study medication may cause headaches"
  Use: "You may get headaches from the study drug"
- Instead of: "Participants have the right to withdraw"
  Use: "You can leave the study at any time"

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST
Before submitting, verify:
- [ ] All relevant document sections quoted in REFERENCES
- [ ] All field names match exactly as specified
- [ ] Array fields contain arrays, not strings
- [ ] JSON is valid and properly formatted
- [ ] Language is consistently at 6th-grade level
- [ ] Direct address ("you") used throughout
- [ ] Active voice maintained
- [ ] No medical jargon remains untranslated
- [ ] Missing information omitted rather than guessed

## OTHER_QUESTIONS GUIDANCE
Develop 5 questions specific to the protocol that address common concerns beyond basic study details. Examples include:
- Radiation exposure concerns for imaging studies
- Anemia worries for frequent blood draws  
- Why so many tests and procedures are needed
- How the study affects their current condition
- Concerns about getting too much of something (scans, blood draws, etc.)

Tailor questions and answers to the specific protocol and provide clear, reassuring responses.`;

Tailor the questions and answers to the specifics of the protocol. Provide answers to those questions."
}  \`\`\`  
## GUIDELINES 
- Extract only information explicitly stated in the protocol
- Translate all medical terminology into simple, everyday language at a 6th grade reading level
- Prioritize the use common words a 6th grader can understand: For example: Replace "malignant neoplastic cells" with "cancer cells that have spread"
- Address readers directly: Use "your body" instead of "the patient's body"
- Use active voice: "Doctors test new treatments" instead of "New treatments are tested"
- Keep sentences and phrases extremely short and consise: Aim for 5-10 words per sentence or phrase.  Fewer is better.
- Maintain a warm, supportive tone throughout 
- If certain information is not in the protocol, omit that field rather than guessing
- Prioritize safety information and time commitments that impact daily life 
- Focus on what matters most: Cover what patients need to know for decisions
- Include approximate timeframes when available (e.g., "about 2 hours" rather than "varies") 
- Use bulleted lists for sequential procedures 
- Present side effects by frequency and severity in plain language
- Structure your response using the exact field names provided 

## EXAMPLES OF ADDRESSING READERS DIRECTLY:
- Instead of: "Participants will undergo three blood draws"
Use: "You will have your blood drawn three times"
- Instead of: "The study medication may cause headaches"
Use: "You may experience headaches from the study medication"
- Instead of: "Participants have the right to withdraw"
Use: "You have the right to leave the study at any time"

##EXAMPLES OF ACTIVE VOICE:
- Instead of: "The report will be submitted by the researcher." Use: We will submit the report.
- Instead of: "The data is being analyzed by our team." Use: "Our team is analyzing the data."
- Instead of: "The medication will be administered." Use: "The study team will administer the medication.
