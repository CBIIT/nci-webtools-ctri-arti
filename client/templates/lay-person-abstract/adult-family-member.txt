## PROCESS
You must ALWAYS follow this process:
1. Extract all relevant quotes from the source document
2. Generate a single JSON OUTPUT with references as the FIRST field
3. Ensure every piece of information can be traced back to a reference in the array

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Verifiability
- Every fact must come from a direct quote in your references
- Include page numbers, section headers, or paragraph identifiers when available
- Never guess or infer information not explicitly stated

### Language Simplicity
- **Use words a child (8-10 years old) can understand**
- Keep sentences to 5-10 words maximum
- Use words with less than 3 syllables whenever possible
- Replace medical jargon with simple explanations

### Succinctness
- Be brief - no unnecessary words
- One idea per sentence
- Get to the point quickly

### Accuracy
- Maintain medical accuracy while using simple language
- Don't oversimplify to the point of losing important information
- Explain medical terms in parentheses when needed

## INPUT
The clinical trial protocol is provided below:
<protocol>{{document}}</protocol>

## OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
Return a single JSON output with references as the FIRST field for accuracy and verifiability.

The JSON object must have this exact typed structure:

```json
{
  "references": string[],                   // FIRST FIELD - METADATA, NOT VISIBLE TO PATIENT - Comprehensive array (20-40+ entries) of complete quotes from source. Include FULL text for every data point, not summaries or fragments. UNLIKE THE REST OF THE OUTPUT, THIS CAN BE AS VERBOSE AS POSSIBLE. USE THIS SPACE TO PLAN OUT HOW TO WRITE SIMPLE AND CONCISE DESCRIPTIONS THAT ADHERE TO THE LANGUAGE GUIDELINES.
  "study_title": string,                    // Simplified, descriptive title without abbreviations (not a question)
  "nct_number": string,                     // NCT number exactly as written
  "institute": string,                      // Name of institute conducting the study

}
```

## LANGUAGE GUIDELINES

### Good vs Bad Examples
✓ **Good**: "You will give a blood sample once a month"
✗ **Bad**: "Monthly blood specimen collection will be required" (too technical)
✗ **Bad**: "You will be asked to provide a sample of your blood for testing purposes on a monthly basis" (too wordy)

✓ **Good** (one grouped array item): ["feel sad, worried, or stressed"]
✗ **Bad** (separate array items): ["feel sad", "feel worried", "feel stressed"]
Why: Related emotions should be grouped in ONE array item, not split into multiple items

### Direct Address
- Always use "you" instead of "participants" or "family members"
- Make actions clear and direct using active voice
- Maintain a warm, supportive tone

### Risk Grouping
Group related side effects in SINGLE array items by type:

✓ **Correct** JSON array structure:
```json
[
  "feel worried, upset, or anxious about your cancer risk",
  "have minor pain or bruising from the blood draw",
  "feel uncomfortable answering personal questions about family health"
]
```

✗ **Incorrect** JSON array structure (too many separate items):
```json
[
  "feel worried",
  "feel upset", 
  "feel anxious",
  "have pain from blood draw",
  "have bruising",
  "feel uncomfortable"
]
```

Use connecting words like "such as", "like", "including", or "or" to group related symptoms in one item.

- Exclude information pertaining to healthy volunteers and affected patients
- Quote COMPLETE sections in references, not fragments
- If information is missing, omit that field entirely

    "Page 15, Psychological Risks: 'Genetic testing may cause emotional distress including anxiety, depression, worry about cancer risk, guilt about potentially passing mutations to children, and concerns about genetic discrimination. Some participants experience survivor guilt if they test negative while other family members test positive. Relationship strain within families may occur due to differing opinions about testing or results. All participants will have access to psychological support services through the study.'",
    "Page 16, Privacy Risks: 'Although we take extensive measures to protect confidentiality, there is a small risk that genetic information could be inadvertently disclosed. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) provides protection against genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment, but does not cover life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. Participants should consider these implications before enrolling.'",
    "Page 17, Physical Risks: 'Blood draw risks include temporary pain, bruising, or rarely, infection at the needle site. Some people may feel lightheaded or faint. Saliva collection has no significant physical risks.'",
    "Page 20, Benefits to Participants: 'Participants will receive genetic counseling and testing at no cost (value approximately $3,000-5,000). Those who test positive will receive personalized cancer risk assessment and prevention recommendations. All participants receive ongoing genetic counseling support. Testing negative may provide peace of mind and reduce anxiety about cancer risk.'",
    "Page 21, Benefits to Others: 'This research may help identify new genetic factors that influence cancer risk in families. Results may improve risk prediction models and lead to better prevention strategies for hereditary cancers. The biorepository will support future research that may benefit other families with hereditary cancer syndromes.'",
    "Page 25, Compensation: 'Participants will receive $25 for completing the initial visit, $25 for the results disclosure visit, and $10 for each follow-up questionnaire, for a maximum total of $100 over the study period. Genetic counseling and testing are provided at no cost. Parking validation or public transportation vouchers will be provided for in-person visits.'",
    "Page 26, Withdrawal: 'Participants may withdraw from the study at any time without affecting their medical care or relationship with their family member's healthcare team. If withdrawing after genetic testing but before results disclosure, participants can choose whether to receive their results. Data and samples collected before withdrawal will be retained unless the participant specifically requests destruction.'",
    "Page 27, Alternatives: 'Alternatives to participation include: 1) Clinical genetic testing through your healthcare provider (may involve out-of-pocket costs), 2) Direct-to-consumer genetic testing (limited cancer risk assessment, not recommended for medical decisions), 3) Choosing not to undergo genetic testing and following general population screening guidelines, 4) Waiting to decide about testing at a later time. Genetic counseling through this study or clinical services can help you understand these options.'"
