## PROCESS
You must ALWAYS follow this process:
1. Extract all relevant quotes from the source document
2. Generate a single JSON OUTPUT with references as the FIRST field
3. Ensure every piece of information can be traced back to a reference in the array

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Verifiability
- Every fact must come from a direct quote in your references
- Include page numbers, section headers, or paragraph identifiers when available
- Never guess or infer information not explicitly stated

### Language Simplicity
- **Use words a child (8-10 years old) can understand**
- Keep sentences to 5-10 words maximum
- Use words with less than 3 syllables whenever possible
- Replace medical jargon with simple explanations

### Succinctness
- Be brief - no unnecessary words
- One idea per sentence
- Get to the point quickly

### Accuracy
- Maintain medical accuracy while using simple language
- Don't oversimplify to the point of losing important information
- Explain medical terms in parentheses when needed

## INPUT
The clinical trial protocol is provided below:
<protocol>{{document}}</protocol>

## OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
Return a single JSON output with references as the FIRST field for accuracy and verifiability.

The JSON object must have this exact typed structure:

```json
{
  "references": string[],                   // FIRST FIELD - METADATA, NOT VISIBLE TO PATIENT - Comprehensive array (20-40+ entries) of complete quotes from source. Include FULL text for every data point, not summaries or fragments. UNLIKE THE REST OF THE OUTPUT, THIS CAN BE AS VERBOSE AS POSSIBLE. USE THIS SPACE TO PLAN OUT HOW TO WRITE SIMPLE AND CONCISE DESCRIPTIONS THAT ADHERE TO THE LANGUAGE GUIDELINES.
  "study_title": string,                    // Simplified, descriptive title without abbreviations (not a question)
  "nct_number": string,                     // NCT number exactly as written

  "who_can_participate": string[],          // Array of main inclusion criteria, everyday language
  "who_cannot_participate": string[],       // Array of main exclusion criteria, everyday language 
  "investigator_names": string[],           // Investigator names

## LANGUAGE GUIDELINES

### Good vs Bad Examples
✓ **Good**: "You will get blood tests every week"
✗ **Bad**: "Weekly phlebotomy procedures will be performed" (too technical)
✗ **Bad**: "You will undergo a process where medical professionals extract blood samples from your veins weekly" (too wordy)

✓ **Good** (one grouped array item): ["have stomach problems like nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea"]
✗ **Bad** (separate array items): ["feel sick to your stomach", "throw up", "have diarrhea"]
Why: Related symptoms should be grouped in ONE array item, not split into multiple items

### Direct Address
- Always use "you" instead of "participants" or "patients"
- Make actions clear and direct using active voice
- Maintain a warm, supportive tone

### Risk Grouping
Group related side effects in SINGLE array items by body system:

✓ **Correct** JSON array structure:
```json
[
  "feel tired, weak, or dizzy",
  "have stomach problems like nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea",
  "get headaches or have trouble sleeping"
]
```

✗ **Incorrect** JSON array structure (too many separate items):
```json
[
  "feel tired",
  "feel weak", 
  "feel dizzy",
  "have nausea",
  "vomit",
  "have diarrhea"
]
```

Use connecting words like "such as", "like", "including", or "or" to group related symptoms in one item.

## EXTRACTION RULES
- Extract ONLY information explicitly stated for affected patients
- Exclude information pertaining to healthy volunteers
- Quote COMPLETE sections in references, not fragments
- If information is missing, omit that field entirely
- Use exact numbers and timeframes when provided
- Prioritize safety information and time commitments

### Reference Requirements for Comprehensive Coverage

Extract and quote COMPLETE sections, not fragments. Your references must include:

STUDY IDENTIFICATION (3-5 references):
- Full title with all subtitles
- Complete protocol numbers, NCT numbers, IND numbers  
- All sponsor and funding information
- Complete investigator names, titles, affiliations, contact details

OBJECTIVES (2-4 references):
- Complete primary objective text
- All secondary objectives in full
- Any exploratory objectives

ELIGIBILITY (10-15 references minimum):
- EACH inclusion criterion quoted in FULL (not summarized)
- EACH exclusion criterion quoted in FULL (not summarized)
- Include all sub-bullets and exceptions
- Include all laboratory values and ranges

PROCEDURES (5-10 references):
- Complete description of each procedure
- Full timeline and schedule details
- All screening procedures
- All treatment procedures  
- All follow-up procedures

RISKS (5-10 references):
- Complete adverse event descriptions
- Include percentages and severity grades when available
- Full text of all warnings and precautions
- Complete contraception requirements

OTHER SECTIONS (5-10 references):
- Complete compensation/payment information
- Full withdrawal procedures
- Complete alternative treatment options
- All contact information

Aim for 20-40+ total references. Include page numbers and section headings.
Quote FULL paragraphs, not sentences. More detail is always better.

Patients who discontinue will be asked to complete a 30-day safety follow-up visit if possible.'",
    "Page 32, Alternative Treatments: 'Alternative treatment options for advanced NSCLC include: 1) Standard platinum-based chemotherapy alone (carboplatin or cisplatin with pemetrexed, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine), 2) Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab or nivolumab for PD-L1 positive tumors, 3) Targeted therapy for patients with EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 alterations, 4) Best supportive care focusing on symptom management, 5) Participation in other clinical trials.
