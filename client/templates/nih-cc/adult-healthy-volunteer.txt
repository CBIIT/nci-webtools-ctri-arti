STORAGE, SHARING AND FUTURE RESEARCH USING YOUR SPECIMENS AND DATA
Will your specimens or data be saved by the study team for use in other studies?
As part of this study, we are obtaining specimens and data from you. We plan to store and use these specimens and data for studies other than the one described in this consent form that are going on right now, as well as studies that may be conducted in the future. The specimens and data will be kept in a way that we will still know that they came from you (i.e., they will be identifiable to us). If we use your identifiable specimens or data for future research, our study will be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board who will make sure that we are protecting your confidentiality. These future studies might help us better understand {{ Disease_Condition}} or other diseases or conditions. This could include studies to develop other research tests, treatments, drugs, or devices, that may lead to the development of a commercial product by the NIH and/or its research or commercial partners. There are no plans to provide financial compensation to you if this happens. Also, it is unlikely that we will learn anything from these studies that may directly benefit you. 
I give permission for my identifiable specimens and data to be stored and used by the study team for future studies as described above.
_____ Yes	_____ No

Will your specimens or data be shared with other researchers for use in other studies?
We may share your specimens and data with other researchers. The other researchers may be doing studies in similar areas to this study or in other unrelated areas. These researchers may be at NIH, other research centers and institutions, or at commercial entities.
One way that we may share your data is by putting it into a large database called a repository, which is a way to make it widely available to the research community.  If we do place your data in a repository, it will be labeled with a code, (not with your name or other information that could be used to easily identify you).  Even though it will only be labeled with a code, some types of data, in particular data about your genes (called genetic or genomic data), can be used to figure out who you are, although this is difficult to do, and we think it is unlikely to happen.
{{Data_Save_Type}}
If we do share your specimens or data, we will know that the specimens and data came from you. However, the other researchers will not know that they came from you (i.e., they will be de-identified).  
I give permission for my de-identified specimens and data to be shared with and used by other researchers for future studies.
_____ Yes 	_____ No
Initial		Initial
In some cases, it may help other researchers to know that the specimens or data were collected from you (i.e., they will have your identifiers). If we share your identity with other researchers, their study will be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board who will make sure that the study team is protecting your confidentiality.

Risks of storage and sharing of specimens and data
When we store your specimens and data, we take precautions to protect your information from others who should not have access to it. When we share your specimens and data, we will do everything we can to protect your identity, for example, when appropriate, we remove information that can identify you. Even with the safeguards we put in place, we cannot guarantee that your identity will never become known, or that no one will gain unauthorized access to your information. New methods may be created in the future that could make it possible to re-identify your specimens and data.
Can you change your mind about use and sharing for future research?
If you change your mind and do not want us to store and use your specimens and data for future studies, you should contact the study team. We will do our best to comply with your request but cannot guarantee that we will always be able to destroy your specimens and data. For example, if some research with your specimens and data is already complete, the information from that research may still be used. Also, if the specimens and data have been shared already, it might not be possible to withdraw them.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST (COI) 
The NIH reviews NIH staff researchers at least yearly for conflicts of interest.  This process is detailed in a COI Guide.  You may ask your research team for a copy of the COI Guide or for more information.  Members of the research team who do not work for NIH are expected to follow these guidelines or the guidelines of their home institution, but they do not need to report their personal finances to the NIH.

CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION AND RESULTS REPORTING 
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time.
CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS PROVIDED IN THIS STUDY  
{{Confidentiality}} 
Will your medical information be kept private? 
We do our best to keep your medical information private.  However, we cannot promise this.  Certain groups may look at and copy your medical records. This may be for research, quality and data review including:
•	The NIH and other government groups. (For example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help keep research safe.) 
•	NIH Institutional Review Board
•	The study sponsor: {{Confidentiality_Study_Sponsor}}
•	{{Confidentiality_Manufacturer}}{{Confidentiality_Drug_Device}}
NIH and researchers doing this study follow special laws and policies to keep your information as private as possible. However, your identity and information about being in this study may accidentally be seen by others. 
In most cases, NIH will not share any identifiable information about you unless you say it is okay in writing.    More information about sharing your information is below.
Information gathered for this study is protected under a Certificate of Confidentiality and the Privacy Act.
Certificate of Confidentiality
To help us protect your privacy, NIH has a Certificate of Confidentiality (Certificate). With this Certificate, researchers may not release or use information about you except in certain cases.  
NIH researchers must not share information that may identify you in any legal proceedings, such as if a court requests it with a subpoena.  
The Certificate does not protect your information when it:  
1.	is shared with people connected with the research. For example, information may be used for internal reviews by NIH; or 
2.	is required by law to be disclosed.  For example, information may be shared with the FDA or with public health agencies.
3.	is for other research if allowed by other regulations;
4.	is shared with your consent. 

Researchers may provide your information when you say it is okay. The Certificate does not keep you from sharing your own information. 
The Certificate will not prevent telling authorities about harm to yourself or others. Examples are child abuse and neglect. 
Privacy Act
The Privacy Act helps keep your NIH medical information confidential.  In some cases, it is different from the Certificate.  Sometimes the Privacy Act allows sharing your information without your permission. An example is if Congress requests it. 
Information may also be shared for some research. It can be given to some federal and state agencies. It can be used for HIV partner notification, or for infectious disease, abuse, or neglect reports.  It may be shared with tumor registries, for quality and medical reviews.  It may also be shared if NIH is involved in a lawsuit.  However, NIH will only release medical record information if allowed by both the Certificate and the Privacy Act.
RESEARCH-RELATED INJURIES  
The NIH Clinical Center will provide short-term medical care for any injury resulting from your participation in research here. In general, no long-term medical care or financial compensation for research-related injuries will be provided by the NIH, the NIH Clinical Center, or the Federal Government. However, you have the right to pursue legal remedy if you believe that your injury justifies such action.
PROBLEMS OR QUESTIONS
If you have any problems or questions about this study, about your rights as a research participant, or about any research-related injury, contact the Principal Investigator, {{Contact_Name}}: By email at {{Contact_Email}} or by phone at {{Contact_Phone}}

Include both physical harms that may occur, as well as non-physical harms such as psychological, emotional, legal, economic, and privacy or confidentiality issues. Risk information should be organized by the intervention with which it is associated. For example, risks of each drug should be listed together, but distinct from risks from other drugs. Physical risks should be described both in terms of magnitude and likelihood. This information may be presented in either a bulleted or table format. Do not include risks for pregnancy or Radiation since that information will be captured in seperate data elements. If death is a foreseeable outcome from the risks of any study intervention, this should be stated by including a statement such as: "Some risks described in this consent document, if severe, may cause death."

If children can also be participants, add this additional statement: "The amount of radiation you will get is less than the NIH Radiation Guidelines of 0.5 rem per year for children." Then add: "Every day, people are exposed to low levels of radiation that come from the sun and the environment around them. This type of radiation is called 'background radiation.' No one knows for sure whether exposure to these low amounts of radiation is harmful to your body. The radiation you will get by being in this study is less than the average yearly background radiation in the United States."

Then add the following statement replacing [ESTIMATE] with the estimate dose in years: The [RAD_PROCS] that you get in this study will expose you to roughly the same amount of radiation as [ESTIMATE] of background radiation. Most of the time, this amount of extra radiation is not harmful to you. However, scientists believe that being exposed to too much radiation can cause harmful side effects. This could include getting a new cancer. We estimate that this could happen in about 1 out of every 1000 people who get a very large amount of extra radiation."

The amount of radiation exposure from these procedures is equal to about [ED_rem]. A rem is a unit of radiation absorbed by the body. Every day, people are exposed to low levels of radiation that come from the sun and the environment around them. The average person in the United States gets a radiation exposure of 0.3 rem per year from these sources. This type of radiation is called 'background radiation.' This study will expose you to more radiation than you get from everyday background radiation. No one knows for sure whether exposure to these low amounts of radiation is harmful to your body. The [RAD_PROCS] that you get in this study will expose you to roughly the same amount of radiation as [ESTIMATE] of background radiation. Being exposed to too much radiation can cause harmful side effects such as an increase in the risk of cancer. The risk depends on how much radiation you are exposed to. Please be aware that about 40 out of 100 people (40%) will get cancer during their lifetime, and 20 out of 100 (20%) will die from cancer. The risk of getting cancer from the radiation exposure in this study is [ED_rem] out of 100 ([ED_rem]%) and of getting a fatal cancer is [FATAL] out of 100 ([FATAL]%)."

## LANGUAGE GUIDELINES

### Good vs Bad Examples
✓ **Good**: "You will get blood tests every week"
✗ **Bad**: "Weekly phlebotomy procedures will be performed" (too technical)
✗ **Bad**: "You will undergo a process where medical professionals extract blood samples from your veins weekly" (too wordy)

✓ **Good** Alternatives: "You could get regular treatment without joining the study or try a different study"
✗ **Bad** Alternatives: "Alternative therapeutic modalities include standard-of-care interventions" (too technical)

✓ **Good** Abbreviated_Risks: "You might feel tired or sick from the drug. Blood draws might cause bruising."
✗ **Bad** Abbreviated_Risks: "Potential adverse events include grade 1-3 fatigue, nausea, and localized hematomas" (too technical)

### Direct Address
- Always use "you" instead of "participants" or "patients"
- Make actions clear and direct using active voice
- Maintain a warm, supportive tone

### Risk Grouping
Group related side effects in SINGLE array items by body system:

✓ **Correct** JSON array structure:
```json
[
  "feel tired, weak, or dizzy",
  "have stomach problems like nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea",
  "get headaches or have trouble sleeping"
]
```

✗ **Incorrect** JSON array structure (too many separate items):
```json
[
  "feel tired",
  "feel weak",
  "feel dizzy",
  "have nausea",
  "vomit",
  "have diarrhea"
]
```
