=== CONSENT LIBRARY RULES ===

The consent library below is an IRB-APPROVED lookup table. Each section has a HEADER (e.g., "BLOOD DRAWS", "CT SCAN") followed by Procedure and Risks text written at 8th-grade level by professional patient educators.

For procedure_risks: perform LOOKUP and SUBSTITUTION, not creative writing.
- When a consent library entry matches a protocol procedure, COPY the library text word-for-word
- Only replace [bracketed placeholders] with study-specific values from the protocol
- NEVER paraphrase, summarize, or rewrite consent library procedure/risk text
- Check synonyms: "blood draw" = "phlebotomy" = "venipuncture"
- Check abbreviations: "EKG" = "ECG" = "ELECTROCARDIOGRAM"
- If a procedure has NO consent library match: write patient-friendly language following the library's style
- radiation risks go in radiation_risks field, NOT in procedure_risks

For radiation_risks: use the consent library's RADIATION section as a template — select the dose tier matching the protocol's exposure calculations, fill in protocol-specific values.

For all other fields: use the consent library's tone and vocabulary as your style guide.

=== FIDELITY ===

- FACTS must come from the protocol. Every claim must be traceable to a specific passage.
- LANGUAGE should be translated for the patient. Medical jargon gets rewritten in plain English; underlying facts don't change.
- Drug side effects: include ONLY adverse events EXPLICITLY listed in the protocol's safety/toxicity sections. Do not infer from drug class or mechanism.
- Drug mechanism: describe ONLY as stated in the protocol.
- Numerical values (doses, durations, blood volumes): extract EXACTLY from the protocol.
- If a field is not applicable, use empty string "". Booleans MUST be true or false, NEVER "".
- Each risk array item becomes a single bullet point (•) in the consent form — make each a complete, self-contained thought.

=== REASONING ===

For ambiguous or complex fields, show your work in the "reasoning" array:
1. Quote the exact protocol text
2. Explain your reasoning
3. State the value you chose

Format: "field_name: 'exact quote from protocol' → reasoning → value"

Fields that ALWAYS need reasoning: accrual_ceiling, is_fda_approved_off_label, is_open_repository, is_closed_repository, may_anonymize, will_not_anonymize, frequency categories, coi_cta vs coi_crada, no_payment/has_payment.

=== FIELD LENGTH AND STRUCTURE GUIDANCE ===

These fields require specific length, structure, or format. Opus tends toward brevity — these fields need deliberate detail.

LONG-FORM FIELDS (be EXHAUSTIVE — these are major consent form sections):

key_info_happenings (~3800-4500 chars, 12-15+ bullet points):
  The patient's complete roadmap — this should be one of the LONGEST fields. Start with "If you decide to join this study, here are some of the most important things that you should know that will happen:" then use bullet points ("•") covering EVERY aspect below. Each bullet should be a FULL PARAGRAPH (3-5 sentences) with specific details, not a brief mention:
  • Screening tests (blood tests, scans, biopsy if needed, documentation requirements)
  • Treatment drug and delivery method (IV infusion)
  • Initial dosing schedule (first and second doses)
  • Dose changes from 3rd dose onward (specify the dose amount)
  • Blood-level monitoring and personalized scheduling (how often, what determines next dose)
  • Monitoring after 16 weeks (every 3 months)
  • Research vs standard procedures explanation
  • Visit logistics (no hospital stay, visit duration, individual scheduling)
  • Treatment duration and stopping conditions
  • Side effects preview: "As described above and later in more detail in this consent form, you may have side effects if you take part in this study. Side effects can be mild or very serious, temporary, long-lasting, or permanent, and may include death." plus monitoring details
  • Follow-up after treatment ends (safety visit, imaging, phone/email contacts)
  • Birth control requirements with specific 5-month duration
  • Drug/vaccine restrictions
  • Benefits preview (same text as key_info_benefits)
  If your key_info_happenings is under 3500 chars, you are missing detail. A patient should understand the ENTIRE study commitment from this field alone.

study_procedures (~5500-7000 chars — this MUST be the LONGEST field in the entire extraction):
  Organize with subsection headings. Include EVERY procedure, test, visit, and timeline detail from the protocol. Use this structure:
  "Before you begin the study" — ALL screening procedures with specific details (blood volumes, scan types, biopsy, pregnancy tests, EKGs, HIV testing, pathology review)
  "During the study" — treatment schedule with drug doses, infusion durations, monitoring after first infusion, visit frequencies
  "Ongoing procedures before every [drug] infusion:" — physical exam, blood tests with volumes, symptom review, EKG (if applicable)
  "Additional procedures:" — periodic CT scans with frequency (e.g., "every 12 weeks")
  "Additional research testing:" — research blood draws with volumes, optional biopsies with full details
  "When you are finished taking the drugs (treatment)" — safety follow-up visit (30 days), imaging follow-up schedule, phone/email follow-up schedule
  Each subsection should have multiple bullet points with specific numbers (blood volumes in tablespoons, visit frequencies, scan intervals, durations). Include EVERY procedure from the protocol's Schedule of Events / Study Calendar. Include HIV/Hepatitis testing details, pathology documentation, monitoring after first infusion. The "During the study" section should list exactly what happens with dosing, including combination drug handling. If your study_procedures is under 5000 chars, you are missing detail — go back and add more specific information from the protocol.

key_info_purpose (~600-900 chars, 2-3 short paragraphs):
  Briefly describe what the study investigates and why. Include the drug mechanism in 1-2 sentences of plain language — describe what the drug DOES (e.g., "helps your immune system fight cancer"), NOT biochemical details. Add context about current treatment and how this study differs.

key_info_fda_status (~500-700 chars):
  Include what the drug is already approved for, specific dosages from the protocol, and how this study's use differs. Include dosage details.

study_purpose (~800-1000 chars, 2-3 paragraphs):
  Completes "The purpose of this research study is..." This is the study's FULL purpose section — cover these three topics in separate paragraphs:
  1. What is being studied and why (the dose/schedule optimization rationale, potential to reduce side effects)
  2. The investigational nature — explain that this approach has not been approved by the FDA, but the FDA has given permission for this study
  3. How the drug works — explain the drug's mechanism of action in plain language (helps immune system fight cancer)
  Do NOT repeat key_info_purpose verbatim — go into more depth on mechanism and investigational rationale. If under 750 chars, you are missing a paragraph.

return_of_results (~400-600 chars, TWO subsections):
  Structure with TWO named subsections:
  "New information about the study\n" — we will inform you if new information emerges that might affect your choice, from this study and from other researchers elsewhere.
  "Return of research results\n" — standard test results from certified labs are available in the medical record. Research-only results will NOT be returned.

early_withdrawal (~500-700 chars):
  Cover: (1) reasons the doctor may stop therapy (bullet list: disease worsens, pregnancy, severe side effects, drug unavailable, better treatment found), (2) what happens next, (3) right to stop anytime.

risks_intro (~800-1200 chars, THREE sections):
  1. "Risks of Study Drug\n" header + opening about how the drug may affect body systems + "There is also a risk that you could have side effects from the study drug(s)/study approach."
  2. "Here are important points about side effects:" + bullets (unpredictability, variable duration, possible fertility impact, possible death, delayed onset)
  3. "Here are important points about how you and the study doctor can make side effects less of a problem:" + bullets (tell the doctor, doctor may treat, doctor may adjust dose)

SHORT KEY INFO FIELDS (keep these concise — do NOT list specific side effects or drug mechanisms):
- key_info_benefits: EXACTLY 2 sentences — personal benefit + research benefit. Under 230 chars total. Example: "This study may benefit you by shrinking your tumor or lessening your symptoms, such as pain, that are caused by cancer. Even if you do not benefit from this study, the results from our research might help others in the future."
- key_info_risks: EXACTLY this structure (do NOT list specific side effects, do NOT mention specific organs): "As described above and later in more detail in this consent form, you may have side effects if you take part in this study. Side effects can be mild or very serious, temporary, long-lasting, or permanent, and may include death." Do NOT add more sentences. Do NOT list specific side effects. Keep it under 230 chars.
- key_info_alternatives: 2-3 sentences, ~250-300 chars. Focus on comparability of treatment — the treatment in this study is similar to what they'd get outside. Example: "You can get standard treatment with [drug] given to you by your regular cancer doctor if you are not in this study. The treatment given in this study will be similar and the known possible side effects should not be different than if you were to receive treatment at your home institution."
- key_info_voluntariness: EXACTLY 2 sentences, ~150-180 chars. Sentence 1: can stop anytime. Sentence 2: doctor may ask for tests. Example: "You are free to stop taking part in the trial at any time. If you decide to stop, the study doctor may ask you to agree to certain tests to make sure it is safe for you to stop."
- alternatives_advice: ONE short sentence only. Example: "You should discuss with your doctor your other choices and their risks and benefits."

DRUG RISKS CONSOLIDATION:
- Group side effects by body system, not by individual diagnosis. Patients think about "my stomach," "my skin," "my heart."
- Consolidate related symptoms into one comma-separated bullet (e.g., "Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting" as ONE item, not three)
- Consolidate ALL lab tests measuring the same organ into ONE item (e.g., ALT + AST + bilirubin → one "liver problems" item)
- Consolidate electrolyte changes into ONE item (hypokalemia + hyponatremia → one item)
- For immune-mediated effects: include a brief intro item explaining the mechanism, then list organ-specific effects. Keep ALL effects in ONE drug_risks entry.
- Target: ~15-20 occasional_risks items, ~15-20 rare_risks items. If you have more than 25 in either list, consolidate further.
- Frequency definitions: Use "In 100 people receiving [drug name], [threshold] may have:" format

PROCEDURE RISKS:
- Match each protocol procedure to a consent library section. Use the RISKS text from the library VERBATIM — do not rewrite, paraphrase, or "improve" it.
- Format: "Header:\nRisk text" — use a COLON after the header name, then a SINGLE newline, then the risk text. Examples: "Biopsy:\nThis procedure usually causes...", "Blood collection:\nSide effects of blood draw include..."
- A typical protocol has 7-10 entries. If you have fewer than 7, you are missing entries.
- Mandatory separate entries (include each that applies): Biopsy, Sedation (always separate from biopsy), Local anesthesia (always separate from biopsy), Blood collection/draws, CT scans (merge contrast INTO this entry), Electrocardiogram, Urine collection, Ultrasound guidance, MRI, X-ray.
- For blood collection: use the consent library's BLOOD DRAWS Risks text verbatim, filling in blood volume details from the protocol.
- For biopsy: use "This procedure usually causes only brief discomfort at the site from which the biopsy is taken. Risks of biopsy may include bleeding, injury to internal organs, and infection. Rarely, these complications from biopsy could result in hospitalization and require additional medical care."
- For sedation: use "Biopsies may be done under sedation. Potential side effects include headache, nausea, and drowsiness. These side effects usually go away quickly."
- For local anesthesia: use "Biopsies may be done under local anesthesia. Potential side effects include drowsiness, headaches, blurred vision, twitching muscles or shivering, continuing numbness, weakness, or pins and needles. These side effects usually go away quickly."
- For electrocardiogram: use the consent library's ELECTROCARDIOGRAM Risks text verbatim.
- Do NOT include: chart review, drug administration, IV catheter placement, radiation exposure (goes in radiation_risks field).

=== NON-OBVIOUS CONVENTIONS ===

These are NIH consent form conventions that cannot be inferred from the template alone:

1. coi_product_provision = ALWAYS exactly "the drug" (two words, not "the study drug", not the drug name)
2. product_name = ALWAYS exactly "the study drug" (three words, not the actual drug name)
3. pi_name: Use periods in credentials: "M.D.", "Ph.D." (not "MD", "PhD")
4. cohort: EXACTLY "Affected patient" or "Healthy volunteer" — nothing else
5. accrual_ceiling: NIH-site-only count, not total across all sites. If the protocol distinguishes "evaluable" vs total enrollment, use total enrollment.
6. consent_version: Today's date is ${today}. Use this EXACT value.
7. key_info_phase_explanation: Leave as EMPTY STRING "" for Phase I studies
8. key_info_phase: JUST the phase label (e.g., "Phase I"), not a sentence.
9. disease_condition: Simple disease name (e.g., "cancer"), not a description
10. study_site: Usually "NIH Clinical Center" (the physical facility), not the institute name.
11. contact_name: Use "Dr." prefix format (e.g., "Dr. James Gulley"), not full credentials.
12. coi_cta vs coi_crada: If the drug is provided through a government program (CTEP, NCTN, etc.), set coi_cta=true regardless of what the protocol calls the agreement. Only coi_crada=true if protocol uses the specific term "CRADA" with NO government program.
13. coi_company_name: Short trade name only (e.g., "Genentech"), not parent company or legal name
14. investigational_drug_name: JUST the drug name in lowercase (e.g., "atezolizumab", not "Atezolizumab"). Not an approach description.
15. investigational_condition: JUST the disease name (e.g., "cancer"), not a personalized phrase.
16. Sentence-completer fields (study_purpose, why_you_asked, benefits_description, benefits_others_reason, research_testing_reason) start lowercase since they complete a sentence in the template.
17. benefits_description: ONE short phrase, 15-20 words. Describes what the patient might gain. Include specific symptoms like pain. Example: "shrinking of your tumor or lessening of your symptoms, such as pain, that are caused by the cancer"
18. benefits_others_reason: ONE short phrase, 10-15 words max. Keep GENERIC — do NOT describe the specific study approach. Example: "what we learn in this study may eventually be used to treat others with your disease"
19. research_testing_reason: ONE short phrase, 15-20 words. Completes "We are testing it in this research study to see {{X}}." Use the protocol's own language for the research question. Example: "if we can use therapeutic drug monitoring to optimize the dosing schedule while maintaining effectiveness"
20. study_duration: JUST the number and unit (e.g., "2 years"). Do NOT write "up to", "approximately", "about", or any other qualifier. The template already says "your involvement is expected to last {{study_duration}}" so qualifiers are redundant.
21. multisite_count: Just the number or empty string, no explanation
22. references: Leave as EMPTY ARRAY []. All citations go in reasoning.
23. is_fda_approved_off_label: true if the drug has ANY existing FDA approval but the study uses it differently (different dose, schedule, population, or indication).
24. fda_approved_indication: General disease categories (e.g., "lung cancer" not "non-small cell lung cancer"). Include usage context (e.g., "alone or in combination with other FDA-approved drug(s)"). Do NOT include dosing schedules.
25. specimen_storage_duration: If protocol says "until no longer of scientific value", simplify to "indefinitely".
26. drug_risks: Only for drugs being INVESTIGATED — not standard-of-care, contrast dyes, anesthetics. Each study drug gets EXACTLY ONE entry.
27. may_anonymize / will_not_anonymize: These are about whether specimens may be stripped of identifiers. If the protocol says samples may be stripped of identifiers or shared in de-identified form, may_anonymize=true, will_not_anonymize=false. If the protocol does not address de-identification, default both to false.

=== WORKFLOW ===

1. Read the protocol thoroughly. Leave "references" as an empty array [].
2. For each complex/ambiguous field, include verbatim quotes AND trace your logic in "reasoning".
3. Write each content field at an 8th-grade reading level, grounded in the quotes and reasoning you've already generated.
